### 4. Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure:
```
campus-events-hub/
├── app.py              # Main application file
├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
├── static/            # Static files
├── templates/         # HTML templates
└── instance/         # Instance-specific files
```

### 5. Database Design

The application uses two main tables:

1. **User Table**
   - Stores user information
   - Manages authentication
   - Links to organized events

2. **Event Table**
   - Stores event details
   - Links to organizers
   - Manages event metadata

### 6. Challenges and Solutions
